# For SignIn And SignUp

1. /signup: The user provides the required credentials and makes a POST request to the endpoint to create a new account. 
The server receives the request, validates the credentials, adds the user to the database, and sends a verification code to the userâ€™s email address.

Request: 

{

    "name":"Ayush Raj",
    "email": "ayursaj@gmail.com",
    "password": "miqcnqke",
    "passwordConfirm": "miqcnqke"


}

Success Response:
{

    "code": 200,
    "msg": "success",
    "model": null
    
}

2. /verifyemail/:verificationCode :
In the email, user recieves a verification code.
However, since there is no frontend application, you need to copy the verification code from the redirect URL and manually make the request to the server.
Paste the verification code in the URL and make a GET request to the /verifyemail/:verificationCode endpoint to verify the email address.
Success Response:
{

    "code": 200,
